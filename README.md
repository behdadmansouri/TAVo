# TAVo: Tor Application detection with Voting critic - CANAI 2023
This repository has all the code used in the experiments carried out in the paper "TAVo: Tor Application detection with Voting critic" [1].

This repository contains the following:
The source code in the Jupyter Notebook named "CIC_Darknet_2020_Classification.ipynb" and the Darknet dataset used for the classification tasks named "Darknet.CSV".  

## Requirements

All the source code was implented in Python language using a Jupyter Notebook.
In order to install python, please check [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

The following packages/tools were used in the project along with Python:
* xgboost 
* seaborn 
* pandas 
* NumPy 
* Matplotlib 
* scikit-learn 
* imbalanced-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages together using pip as follows:
```console
pip install xgboost seaborn pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn imblearn notebook
```

Or individually as follows:
```console
pip install scikit-learn
```
```console
pip install pandas
```
```console
pip install matplotlib
```
```console
pip install imblearn
```
```console
pip install numpy
```
```console
pip install seaborn
```
```console
pip install xgboost
```
```console
pip install notebook
```

## Running the Program
* Install the required packages and tools
* Launch the Jupyter Notebook interface by typing the command "jupyter notebook" in the command prompt
* Open the .ipynb file after navigating to the project folder and run all the cells
**Note:** Make sure that the .CSV file and the .ipynb file are in the same location.
